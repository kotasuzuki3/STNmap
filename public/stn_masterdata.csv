She was very protective. She wouldn’t let anyone bully me. I was her sister; we could always talk about anything. She was so creative. The way she dressed was artistry itself. We’re kind of opposites that way. I’m more conservative. She always wanted to stand out… And Kayla used her words; that girl could talk. She was highly intelligent. It wasn’t just ranting; she was very articulate. She was always having to stand up for herself, because people can be cruel. We just loved her the way she was. As a teenager, my pet peeve was she would always go in my room and steal my clothes. It was hard for her to get clothes. She wanted to dress feminine, so she’d take mine. And she looked good, I can’t deny that. She knew how to work it,” Maria laughed. “One of my favorite memories… I was three and Kayla was five years old, and my grandma had gotten me a nightgown for Christmas. It was yellow and had lace at the bottom. It was so cute. So I go in the living room, and Kayla is wearing my nightgown, turning around in circles with her arms out – this little brown kid with an afro, wearing this pretty yellow night gown. She had a strong spiritual side. She was always giving blessings; that was her way of giving her love. The ironic thing is that, whenever Kayla was having a hard time, she’d say ‘I’m just gonna put blessings out there and see what comes back.’ And it would come back! I’d be like, ‘How did you do that?’ She’d be down on her luck, and suddenly someone’s offering her an apartment. Or she’d be out of money, and a check would come in the mail."""

At heart, he was a good boy struggling to exist and confronted with so many competing options.” Shaaliver, known as Shaalie to his friends, grew up in the Gouverneur Morris Houses, a sprawling public housing project that runs along Washington Avenue in the Bronx. He was the only child of Shanise Farrar, 40, who had worked as a security officer at the Salvation Army. His father, Oliver Douce, did not live with them but came to visit. His family and many of his friends, angered by what has been reported about Shaaliver, have been unwilling for the most part to share many personal details of his life. But shortly before his death, Shaaliver had confided to a close friend that he wanted to go to college and to get serious about boxing, because that could lead to a career and a future. “He wanted to get out of the projects,” said the friend, Aileen Nunez, 19. “He wanted to move on with his life.” Shaaliver attended a Head Start program at a neighborhood church, and an elementary school, Public School 55, across the street from his building. He went for a few years to P. S. 186, a school for students with special needs. One educator there said that Shaaliver usually followed directions and did not get into fights, and that his mother was an involved parent. Last fall, he entered the ninth grade at Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School. Ms. Farrar said his favorite subjects were history and math, and that he made the honor roll. At home, he loved eating pancakes and waffles with syrup, and could belt out the lyrics to “Bad Boys” when he was young, his relatives said. He played basketball and video games. Neighbors remembered him as polite and respectful. In fact, he was the one who sometimes was bullied by bigger boys, his friends and neighbors said. “He was quiet,” recalled Ernest Nesby, 24, a maintenance worker who considered Shaaliver a little brother. “He would get picked on a lot because he was so small.”"

One just came out late. That's how Georgia Ferrell always described Jonathan and Willie, the youngest of her five children. Jonathan was born in October 1988, and Willie arrived 16 months later. On the family's plot of farmland outside Tallahassee, the two boys raced and wrestled and wrangled animals. On Christmas Eve 1993, their father, Willie James Ferrell, died of a brain tumor. After that, friends and relatives suggest, Jonathan and Willie became each other's surrogate dad. They had a slightly different assessment. According to Willie, ""It's more like we were each other's big brother."" Describing Jonathan and Willie as close doesn't capture the dimensions of their relationship. When Jonathan was diagnosed with an allergy to seafood, Willie, in solidarity, stopped eating seafood too. When Willie, a lefty, tore ligaments in his dominant hand, Jonathan taught him how to write righthanded, which Willie does to this day. During one high school football game, Willie broke his leg; Jonathan charged onto the field and, fueled by love and adrenaline, carried him to the sideline. Three weeks later Jonathan's grass allergy acted up during a game; Willie, broken leg and all, hobbled from the field to the team bus to get his brother's inhaler. For as long as they could remember, the brothers felt a sting when they had to say goodbye to each other. So they didn't. In person and on the phone, they parted by simply saying, All right then. Yeah. ""Saying goodbye,"" says Willie, ""was too, like, final."" From early on, Willie was every bit as big as his big brother. Jonathan was confused for Willie and Willie for Jonathan, and everyone assumed they were twins. Temperamentally, though, they could scarcely have been more different. Jonathan spoke only when he felt he had something worth saying. He was an admitted mama's boy who, even as a teenager, would climb into Georgia's bed. He hated balloons; the pop scared him. He loved the Detroit Lions because there was something ennobling about rooting for a team so hopeless. Jonathan took in stray animals—not just dogs and cats but also spiders and snakes. Once, when Willie was about to kill a cockroach, Jonathan said, ""If you're not going to eat it, you can't kill it."""

He was a tough kid who’d gotten his education at the Rhode Island Training School. He was also likeable, a good basketball player, and he had mentors who hoped he’d find his way off the streets. Kobi Dennis, the founder of Project: Night Vision, a mentoring program for teenagers, met Cooper while teaching at the Training School. At 16, Cooper was guarded, Dennis remembered. “He had too many false promises, too many people had let him down, but finally we formed a relationship,” Dennis said. “He was trying to do his best for his mom. He wasn’t an evil kid. I think he just didn’t see a way out.” He saw Cooper cycle through the Training School and transitional programs. “He’s a kid from the system,” Dennis said. “He would go home and do whatever he wanted [on weekends], and then he’d go back and play the game.” Dennis said that Cooper had begun to trust him. He wanted help getting a job. Dennis wanted him to speak to the teens in Project: Night Vision about keeping away from the streets. “I believed this kid was a leader,” Dennis said. “The kids would have listened to him.” Cooper had been involved in the juvenile offender reentry program, working with street workers Ajay Benton and Dimky Edouard over the last four years, Gross said. They saw his potential, but the program ended when the funding dried up in 2012. Dennis said he also felt responsibility. “Douglas Cooper is probably the face of hundreds of kids every day,” Dennis said. “So many kids are facing the same crossroads.”"

Antoquan was respectful, although he didn’t deal with a lot of people, his uncle said: “You could kind of call him a loner.” In 2001, Antoquan lost his mother at 14. He was left in the care of her mother, Pamela Watson. Even after leaving his grandmother’s home, Antoquan would always call and stop by to make sure she was OK, Kevin Watson said. Then, almost exactly a year before he would die, Antoquan lost his grandmother on April 1, 2013. “With the two women that took care of him passed, I think it may have caused a major breakdown on his mental health,” Watson said."

Nathaniel Hamilton Sr., the father of Dameion, Nate and Dontre, was a steel worker in Gary. He bought the three boys boxing gloves when they were young. Dontre was stocky and short, just under 5-foot-6. Nate had always been tall and slender, but Dontre was scrappy and could always beat Nate at the sport. Maria moved the family to Milwaukee in 1995, when Dontre was in sixth grade. The boys didn’t readily adapt to Milwaukee, and Maria took them back to Indiana every weekend so they could visit friends and their father, and splash around in the community swimming pool they missed. Still, all four of them graduated from Vincent High School on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side and adapted, with Dontre emerging as the “cool guy,” according to Dameion, now 36. “He had a little perm and gold rings and always the cleanest car,” recalls Dameion, a service technician. “He lived like he was rich, and would always play the lottery, saying one day, he was going to hit it.” The desire to be rich prompted Dontre to start working at a gas station at age 13. He volunteered to work double shifts and played the lottery every day. When he wasn’t working, he spent his time listening to music and watching movies. Donnie Brasco and The Godfather trilogy were his favorites. He could recite the words to the scripts."

Now, he looks back to the night before Laquan died, when they danced, listened to music and cracked jokes at a party at Mr. Wilson’s house in Austin, a neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side. Every time you saw Corn Dog, “he always stayed in some fresh designer clothes,” Mr. Wilson, now 26, said. “He didn’t want to do nothing but express himself and be fun around people.” Laquan, who had just celebrated his birthday, intended to spend the next few days at Mr. Wilson’s house. He left to get a change of clothes. His friend never saw him again. He remembers Laquan as a friendly young man, always outside chatting with neighbors in Austin. One day in 2012, Mr. Wilson stopped him on the sidewalk. They talked, and the two hung out almost every day after that. One day at Mr. Wilson’s house, Laquan imitated the side-to-side hip swing “Shmoney Dance” performed by the hip-hop artist Bobby Shmurda. It was hilarious and corny at the same time, Mr. Wilson said. “He was just so loving, too,” Mr. Wilson said. “Even though we come from a bad place and stuff — and a lot of people knew him even though he was younger and stuff, he was known throughout the West Side of Chicago.” “He was just beginning his life,” Mr. Wilson said. “He was one of them guys that was all about fun. I will never be the same.”"

His mother, Sylvia, let his father, David Gurley, pick the name: Akai, for a Japanese stereo company that made his favorite speakers, and Kareem, after the Laker. Three months after his birth, Gurley flew with his parents and two older brothers to the U.S. mainland.

They stayed with Sylvia’s sister, Hertencia, in the Bronx; then, when they could afford it, they moved to Brooklyn, living in and out of public housing. As a small child, Gurley was quiet to the point of concern. “Once, his teacher thought there might be something wrong with him,” his mother told me, “but in elementary school, the real Akai came out. Laughing, joking. Lots of fun.” When he was 6, his parents split up. He saw his father occasionally, then rarely, then not at all. “When he was 10 he came to me and said, ‘Mommy, where’s my daddy?’” Sylvia said, adding, “I told him, ‘I don’t know, Akai, but I’ll help you look for him.’” They searched online and in phone books, and called friends of friends. Gurley was obsessed with finding him, but David could not be found. “After a while, he said, ‘Mommy, my daddy is in prison or he’s dead.’” And so they went through prison databases. “When nothing came up, Akai assumed his father was dead.”

Gurley inherited his mother’s fastidiousness. After Gurley's death, his fiancé, Kimberly Ballinger, showed Sylvia his closet, where clothes were organized by color and each pair of shoes was in its original box, just like in her own closet. As a kid, Gurley loved fashion and dreamed of becoming a rapper; he carried a karaoke machine from room to room, practicing. Akai Gurley had big plans for Thanksgiving. The 28-year-old was going to surprise his mother in Florida, heading down from New York City on the Chinatown bus with his fiancé and their two kids. He wanted to finally introduce her to his 2-year-old daughter, Akaila.

When he was a kid, his family would jokingly call him Girly-Gurley when he took too long getting ready. “He liked to look good, but when it came to his mom, he liked to look real good,” said Hertencia Petersen, his aunt. So the night before his Florida trip, on the evening of Nov. 20, 2014, Gurley went to visit his friend and former neighbor, Melissa Butler, to get his hair done."

He was always smiling or, you know, he was always happy. It was rare that you’d see Brandon and he was mad,” Manzano said. “He was always smiling. His mother, Ms. Tanya, she was a strict mother when he was younger. I remember, he would come on my block and blow my mom kisses. He knew it would get on her nerves. And she’d be like, ‘Brandon, I’m gonna go tell your mother.’ and he’s like ‘I’m sorry, Ms. Angie, please don’t go tell my mom.'” she laughed. “He was so funny. He was alive, you know?”

Tate-Brown’s at-times goofy demeanor would shine through in posts to social media. “He was never mad,” she recalled. “Even now, I can’t remember one time when he was upset about something. He’s never had an issue with anybody that I can even think of, or put a finger on. I’ve never even seen him fight, he wasn’t an angry person.”"

Meagen passed away on March 28, 2015 at age 26. As a child, she attended Peabody Charter School where Meagen's kindergarten teacher read her class the story of Polly Anna. It became her favorite story and song at that time. As such, she came home that day and renamed herself Polly Wolly Doodee which stuck and as a family we continued to call her a selection of closely related favorite nick names, Polly Wolly, Poll, and Meagen's big sister Mayesha’s personal favorite, Paulina. Meagen attended Santa Barbara Jr. High and S.B. High School where she and her big sister Mayesha were selected as the cheerleading squad captains. A big part of Meagan's life was when she was there for her baby sister Ge'mia's (Mia) birth where she held her mother's hand through the entire C-section and was the one who cut the umbilical cord. Mia was delivered and handed straight to Meagen. The bond the two shared surpassed the normal bond of sisters and will forever be a blessing of epic proportion in Ge'mia's life. Meagen also took part in helping raise her niece Keara and was like a second mother to her and her sister Ge'mia who are only 7 months apart. Megean leaves behind to mourn her three beautiful little angels Nevaeh Marie Morado (little nae), Zaniyah Grace Morado (Gracey), and Mariah Hope Morado (peanut). She also leaves behind their father, her partner in life and love Luis Antonio Morado and her adoring mother Monique Wallace, whose love for Meagen could not be put into words. She also leaves to miss and mourn her two sisters Mayesha Rae Charlton and Ge'mia Tenae Person, and her niece Keara Chanel and nephew Keevon, all with whom she had extremely close bonds. She also leaves her aunt Pearl and uncle and God father Ron Slauterbeek of Santa Barbara. Meagen's daughters were her life’s greatest blessings which gave her unspeakable joy. They have been told mommy is in Heaven with God and is a beautiful star in the sky looking over us all."

In 1984, the 19-year-old Scott left his parents’ Charleston home to join the US coast guard, which he served in for two years, last stationed in Baltimore, before a “discharge under honorable conditions”, spokesperson Lisa Novak said. He returned to South Carolina in the late 1980s, and married his first wife, Lisa Aiken, in 1993. The couple lived in and around Charleston for almost the decade, before divorcing in the early 2000s. Scott had proposed to his current girlfriend Charlotte Jones, and friends have described the couple’s relationship as mutually adoring. “The adoration he had for her was so immense it was crazy,” friend Romaine Scott said, adding that she and her partner wanted their own relationship to be “tight-knit like that”. Relatives said Scott had a good relationship with his four children, two of them now in their 20s. Anthony, Scott’s older brother, said that the mother of Scott’s two older children “is deceased. But he brought them [his four children] together as brothers and sisters like they were brothers and sisters from the same mother. Now they have lost their father.” “Everybody loved him,” his mother told reporters. “He was the most outgoing out of all of us. He knew everybody,” his older brother said. His brothers, 52-year-old Anthony and 48-year-old Rodney, described Scott’s fanatical love of the Dallas Cowboys. He would go so far as to call his brothers while watching to shout about a big play, they said. He also loved music. He sang for the church choir and played drums, his parents and friends say. He enjoyed nights drinking a couple of beers and playing dominoes with friends, and the brothers had enjoyed a reunion three weeks ago to celebrate a surprise 50th anniversary party for their father and mother. “I loved him to death,” University of Mississippi football player Fadol Brown said in a tweet. The mother of Brown’s longtime girlfriend had been dating Scott, and he had seen him as a father figure, Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze told the Post and Courier."

In 2008, a lead-paint lawsuit was filed on behalf of Gray and two of his sisters against the owners of the home in which they grew up. Court papers described his difficult upbringing: a disabled mother addicted to heroin who, in a deposition, said she could not read; walls and windowsills containing enough lead to poison the children and leave them incapable of leading functional lives; a young man who was four grade levels behind in reading. Such lawsuits are so common in Gray’s neighborhood that the resulting settlement payments — which Gray lived off of — are known as “lead checks.” Close friends of Gray, who was 5-foot-8 and 145 pounds, described him as loyal and warm, humorous and happy. “Every time you saw him, you just smiled because you knew you were going to have a good day,” said Angela Gardner, 22, who had dated him off and on over the previous two years."

Civil war between the central Sudanese government in Khartoum, local paramilitary groups, and the fractious Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) had begun three years before. The violence hit civilians in the surrounding Bahr el Ghazal region hard. By the late 1980s, a manmade famine and targeted attacks by Khartoum-aligned militias in Bahr el Ghazal had driven thousands of Dinka civilians like Manyoun from their homes. Some settled in northern Sudan, while others, Manyoun included, traveled across the border to refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. He left behind his parents, a twin brother, and four sisters.

After spending six years in a camp along the Ethiopian border, Manyoun made his way to Kakuma, Kenya in 1992, where a UN refugee camp had been established the year before. He was one of thousands of children who had fled violence and hunger accompanied by few or no family members. Those who arrived in Kenya were lucky; most of the 20,000 children who made the long initial trek from southern Sudan to Ethiopia—and later, to Kakuma—did not survive. Manyoun arrived in Nashville, Tennessee in 2001 with approximately 150 other Lost Boys. Manyoun moved to Louisville in 2008, where a cousin of his promised him a fresh start. "

Though he worked many jobs, Spencer realized he had a knack for ALWAYS helping others. This gift, nurtured by his loving mother, led him to pursue a career in the field of phlebotomy.

Immediately upon meeting this attractive young man, many would say that he just seemed like a ""Breath of Fresh Air."" And like a true man when he spoke with you, his ""intense gaze"" commanded your attention. That bright sparkle in his eyes, a trait his father still possesses, was as inviting as his warm smile and calm demeanor. There is no doubt, these are a just a few of the qualities which captured Shannon's heart since they were youngsters, and together they produced three beautiful children: Saniya, Nia and Kai.

She graduated in 2009 with a degree in agriculture. At Prairie View, she was recruited as a summer counselor for three years, played in the marching band, and volunteered for a senior citizens advocacy group. Bland returned to Illinois in 2009. She worked in administration for Cook's Direct, a food-service equipment supplier, a job she left shortly before her death. She had been due to start a temporary job on August 3, 2015, with Prairie View as a summer program associate. In January 2015, Bland began posting videos about many subjects, including police mistreatment of African Americans. In one post she wrote, ""In the news that we've seen as of late, you could stand there, surrender to the cops, and still be killed.""  She has been described as a civil rights activist in Chicago, and a part of the Black Lives Matter movement."

Most of all, Penn said, he knew Tignor to be a family man. “He always was saying, ‘I love my family. I really love my family.’ And as brothers out here in our community, we got to the point where we told each other we loved each other very often, to set that example for the youth and the other people in the community,” he said. “His cousins said, matter of fact, he’d just left their house (Saturday.) He left four to five times and came back telling them how much he loved them. Then the fifth time he left he didn’t come back, and then they heard about the incident.” “His past doesn’t make his life insignificant,” Penn said. “Our concern in the community is that this thing has gotten a lot of people upset and we don’t want to shade his character. We want everyone to remember him as the Ben we knew, not 20 years ago, but the Ben we knew yesterday — the one that shows love, compassion.”"

His obituary testified to his love for swimming and fishing, noted that he had been working for a local trucking company and car wash, and recalled that “as a child, Jamar was always full of energy  and had a big smile.” Hill, his brother, recalled the excitement in Clark’s voice when he called several months ago to relay the news that he had gotten a new job at the car wash. “You would had thought he hit the lottery for $50 million,” Hill said with a smile. Several of the speakers used their remarks to return to Clark’s final Facebook post — his premonition of his own death and his public pondering of whether his life would serve a higher purpose. “Jamar had a purpose,” Sutton said. “Jamar had a purpose. He was put on this earth with a purpose…to unite us.”"

He was short, but pictures from his youth show a handsome, confident man. Family members remember him as a ""Casanova"" with girlfriends to spare.

After dropping out of high school, Meat-Meat traveled with a woman to New York with dreams of starting his own roofing business and building a family. But before long, he returned to live at home in Virginia, leaving behind his wife and at least two children.

Down South again, Meat-Meat suffered from depression. But he joined a roofing company, where he got steady work during the 1990s, until a truck accident killed a close friend and coworker. Meat-Meat survived that accident, but the experience stayed with him.

""He just didn't want to get back up on the roof after that,"" his sister Sharon said.

Work was sporadic in the following years, and Meat-Meat drifted. He loved to go to the public library, and take walks. Frequently, he would imitate Kung Fu films. Sharon recalls once seeing him in the backyard, acting out improvised martial arts moves with a long stick used for painting, spinning it and swinging it like Donatello from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."

He was an avid lover of sports, and at an early age his athletic talents proved to be a gift that would take him farther than he could imagine.
Isaiah was well-known for his impeccable athletic ability on the football field and the basketball court. He was the starting point guard and quarterback for Huffman High School, where he was honored as Most Valuable Player for both sports. It was at Huffman High School where Coach Steve Ward took Isaiah under his wings and began to mold him into an awesome athlete and a respectable young man. Coach Ward played a very pivotal role in Isaiah’s life; he was not only his coach but he was a friend and took on the role of a father-figure to Isaiah. Coach Ward was a great mentor, and Isaiah truly loved him.
Isaiah was not just athletically inclined; he was the true definition of a student athlete. He graduated Huffman High School in the Top 10 of his class and scored a 28 on the ACT his first time taking the test. He was an extremely intelligent young man. His athletic and academic gifts awarded him honors in scholarship offers totaling $1.2 million.
Following graduation, Isaiah received and accepted an academic scholarship to LaGrange College in Georgia, where it did not take long for his athleticism to prevail. During his time there, Isaiah was named Rookie of the Week and Player of the Week. The next year, he transferred to Lawson State Community College, where he was a member of the Men’s Basketball Program. In 2015, he graduated with Honors and received his Associate Degree in General Studies. Isaiah then received a full athletic scholarship to Miles College, where he attended in the Fall of 2015.
Isaiah was loved by so many and left a lifelong impression with all who knew and loved him. His smile lit up a room and brightened the day of anyone he encountered. He was blessed with a genuine love for people. He left with us memories of his humble, silly, and beautiful spirit. He is resting in God’s arms now. https://www.deerfootmemorialfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Isaiah-Core/#!/Obituary "

Ramirez was not afraid to work with his hands and would do odd jobs and handyman work for his family and others, his godmother Amy Cooper said. “He had a great sense of figuring out how things worked so he could fix whatever wasn’t working right,” she said. “He was an amazing young man who was the first person you would call if something was broken or you just couldn’t sleep and wanted to talk to someone.” Though he loved his family and made them his highest priority, Ramirez had mental issues and was in therapy trying to make himself better, Cooper said."

“The music that he made was just all about the struggle, and trying to identify himself with everyone that walked in the same footsteps as him,” said Damariee Cole, McCoy’s nephew.

“Everybody has a skill, and his skill was music,” Cole said. “He wanted everybody to understand his background and where he came from; his struggle, and letting everybody know that, you know, you can come out of poverty and be something.”

McCoy grew up in Sacramento and Vallejo. He was in Sacramento until his father died of mesothelioma when he was about 11 years old. He moved to Vallejo to live with his mom. About two months later, she died of breast cancer, said Harrison.

“He had a good culture to him you know,” Harrison said. “Willie was raised by the village by all of the family and the whole community.” Since McCoy’s death, members of his rap groups have struggled to stay motivated.

“Willie was a leader,” he said. “Sometimes we didn't want to do projects or go to the studio or write rhymes. Willie was always writing when there was no beat. He would be right in his car and he would have a full song already written out with no beat. So, when you lose a leader with somebody that's given us that extra motivation, you know, it's hard to continue.”

It’s also hard to be around everyone else in the group. It’s a reminder of who’s not there.

“When Willie was there, we always was one,” he said. “Now it’s like when we get together, it just reminds us so much of Willie that all of us just doing our own thing.”"

Lauderdale at Broward General Hospital. She was a gorgeous, vibrant, and beautiful baby girl. Born to the parentage of Carlos Gonzales and the late amazing Brenda Lee Walton Wright who Tasha deeply cherished. After giving birth to Latasha, standing right by her side in the delivery room was her then boyfriend turned husband Alphonso Wright Sr. who took Tasha as his own and they both raised her and showered Latasha with true love, peace, joy and happiness. She admired the union they shared. Tasha was the oldest of her two siblings Allison Shemia Wright (Worm) and her brother Alphonso Wright Jr. (Man- Man). The three siblings all shared the same room, the same dreams where they laughed together, played together and often times got each other in trouble by pulling pranks and telling jokes with each other. The had an amazing childhood and over time they built this dynamic bond where they were inseparable and were one another’s best friend. She started her elementary education in the Broward County School System at Broadview Elementary on to Charles Drew Elementary School in Pompano Beach, then to Crystal Lake Middle School where she participated in many activities such as “Lady’s Intrigued” a program for young women on a mission for greatness. Finally she completed her education at Blanche Ely High School where she was well know, loved and admired by many of her classmates.Later after her education was completed as she entered into adulthood she met her first love and father to her children Lafortune Normil Sr. they spent ten years together and birth their own two bundles of joy; Lafortune Normil Jr (Nunu) who was their pride and joy; and six years later they welcomed their last amazing baby boy Jeremiah (Duke) Normil.
Shortly after living their every day life with one another they received the worst news they ever could imagined, in the late summer June 22, 2003; the family suffered a terrible loss and was completely devasted to learn their 35 year mother gained her wings and was called home to eternal life in Heaven with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The three children, then 16,14 and 12 were shocked, broken and lost. Latasha did not let that break her, she was able to push through every obstacle in her way even heartbreak and she immediately became a mother to her siblings and her very own son Nunu (only 3months old at the time), she raised them all as her own by working two jobs and providing a roof over their heads.Time passed by and the three siblings remained close and intimate with each other celebrating every birthday, holiday and family vacation through out the years along with close family and friends.Latasha finally found her true love and lifelong partner in her fiancé Steve Charles who proposed to her on her birthday last year with a diamond ring. She was floored by the new engagement and was set to be married in 2020. They shared five beautiful years together and two unfortunate miscarriages due to a few complications. They mourned together and their bond grew even closer; they pushed through and spent countless hours of joy, peace and happiness in complete bliss every single day they lived side by side. She would often say “Allison I Found my husband.” Earlier this year they settled down in the beautiful and pleasant city of Boca Raton, Florida. Latasha was a phenomenalmother and aunt to her children as well as her three nephews Jayden, Arlo and Mason and one niece Breonna, she would often say. She loved and provided for them like her own, she would always remind me saying “Sis I’m going to work hard and provide a lifestyle better than we had growing up for all of us” and she meant just that. Tasha was an active, kindhearted mother: every morning she would wake them up, dressed her children, fixed them breakfast and drive them to and from school. She loved being a mother and aunt; her nephews and niece would often say she was the world’s greatest because she would give them anything they asked for and every thing she did was full of love and was done with a pure heart. The kind of heart she had was bigger than life and to see other people happy was always her priority. She did the same for every single person in her family, a countless number of friends, and even strangers she would just meet. She loved and she loved hard and anyone that knew her around the world can attest to the fact that she was a class act. She adored FAMILY and Friends and just wanted the best for everyone around her. As time passed she grew into her own wisdom of what she wanted for herself and began her professional career and became her own Boss and opened her own business of distributing hair/wigs and other beauty products. Her small business was excelling and she was so proud of her future endeavors to expand. "

(They were married six weeks later in Maryland, as both Sylvester and Iyun had family members in the United States.) The couple moved to the United States in 1987 to attend Cornell University, Iyun for her Ph.D. in English and Sylvester for his master’s degree and Ph.D. in organizational behavior in the Industrial and Labor Relations School. In the summer of 1992, the family moved to State College. Their home, in an area off Westerly Parkway, was a gathering place for neighborhood children. They played badminton, croquet and soccer in the backyard, which was also equipped with a treehouse and swing set. “You couldn’t get the grass to grow because they played everything back here,” Iyun says.

Osaze was a joyful child. “He would laugh the loudest,” his mother recalls.

Sylvester remembers vividly, when his children were young, that they loved when “each time I went into their room, I jumped on a bed, and they would scream and jump on me.”

Osaze was a peacemaker. “He was a very calm boy,” Sylvester says. “Each time people were in conflict, he was the one in the middle trying to make sure that everything was settled.”

And Osaze could barely be separated from his Bible. Iyun and Sylvester didn’t have to persuade their eldest son to go to church. He did it willingly. He even attended Bible studies with them. Even as the only child there, he was an active participant.

As a teenager, Osaze was in the youth ministry at State College Assembly of God, where Pastor Zac McDonald was a youth pastor. Osaze attended weekly youth group meetings, participated in a Bible quiz program and went on trips. When McDonald and his wife launched State College Access Church five years ago, the Osagie family started attending services there.

He was a “very kind, gentle-spirited” young man, McDonald says. He always had a “big, golden smile” on his face.

Osaze would come to church early to pore over his Bible and pray. “Church wasn’t just a place that he went to; it was more than that. He had a relationship with Jesus,” McDonald remembers. “He was always talking to me about things he was reading in the Bible.”"

I know he listened. Teachers and social workers, moved by his willingness to out-hustle his many deficits, worked overtime themselves, finally teaching him to read in high school and helping him become the first in his family to enroll in college.

His mother, Charlene Davis, who died in 2011, lived with schizophrenia and bipolar disease, Williams said. She was unable to raise Davis when he was young, so Davis grew up in foster care in different parts of Louisiana. Parker and Williams also said they believe Davis was molested as a boy.

He was not treated for his mental health problems while in foster care as far as she knew, Williams said. At the time of this death, Davis was living off of his disability benefits.

“This whole thing could have been prevented if he had proper mental health,” Williams said.

Davis had been living with his mother a few years before she died and found her dead when he returned from a trip to the drug store, Parker and Williams said. Davis wasn’t capable of handling it, Williams said, noting he didn’t call for first responders when he found her, but called her “crying hysterically.”

“Ever since that he went into a deep depression,” Williams said."

In 2006, Davenport was shot and killed in Chicago. The man who killed him was later sentenced to 50 years in prison. McGee said after Davenport’s death, Bridges took on the role of big brother to his siblings. Bridges would call McGee “Wonder Woman,” she said, because she would make anything happen for her children. McGee said she doesn’t feel like Wonder Woman anymore. She feels like she let him down. “That’s what I would tell people: Love your kids while you’ve got ‘em,” McGee said. “Because you never know when they’ll be gone.” Bridges loved to dance. In April last year, Bridges and McGee had a dance-off at the annual party they threw to celebrate Davenport’s life. Bridges would dance with his sister’s children too. Cox said Bridges loved to cook, especially soul food. Two of his favorite things to make were fried pork chops and macaroni, she said, but he could cook anything. Bridges wanted to be a homeowner and buy houses for Cox, McGee and his grandmother. He and Cox had a plan to succeed. It was something they had dreamed about for years. She would sell books and he wanted to start his own trucking company. “All he wanted was to make it out the projects,” Cox said. “My brother wanted something out of life.” In 2018, Bridges moved to Kansas City with his girlfriend. He was planning on moving back to Chicago in July 2019, McGee said. Cox had been looking at apartments for him and his girlfriend.

He was the first born to his proud parents, Scott and Taun Hall.  Miles spent the vast majority of his life in Walnut Creek. He attended Parkmead Elementary School, Walnut Creek Intermediate School and graduated from Las Lomas High School as a member of the Class of 2014.

Miles was a brilliant self taught musician who composed beautiful music. He learned to play guitar, piano and crafted eloquent beats on his computer. He also produced music for his friends which helped them express themselves and realize their musical potential. His music was amazing and was a gift to those who heard it.

Miles was often seen riding his beach cruiser bike around his neighborhood and downtown Walnut Creek. He said he loved the feel of the wind blowing on his face and hair. His favorite destinations were Civic Park or Heather Farms where he enjoyed hanging out.

Miles was kind hearted, sweet, and had an infectious smile that would light up a room. He could walk into any room and instantly bond with people and make them feel comfortable. He was gentle, funny, and his playful spirit would constantly make his friends and family laugh. He was a beautiful soul who brought so much joy to his family, friends, and community. 

Miles had an inquisitive mind and wanted to know literally everything. The only limit to his questions was the patience of the person he was asking. His inquiring mind was never satisfied. He listened to every response to the questions he asked. However, if he didn't truly believe the response he would research or test the subject on his own until he found his own suitable answers. His friends and family quickly learned they had to answer truthfully, and often ""I don't know"" was the best you could do.

Family was very important to Miles. He spent many hours reading and discussing the Bible with his grandmother Edi, traveling with his Granny, Auntie, Happy Pappy and Grand Mommy. He spent holidays rough-housing with his cousins. He loved camping and snowboarding with his extended family of friends and neighbors. The most important person in Miles' life was his little sister Alexis. He loved her more than anything in the world and protected her at all costs. She was his best friend and their bond was unbreakable.

Miles suffered from mental illness, an affliction he battled the best he could. Unfortunately Miles lost the battle, but not to mental illness. He lost to the system that failed him. Miles lost his life in order to bring awareness to this growing problem. Mental illness is real and prevalent, but change is coming. Miles' family and friends are determined to bring about this change.

But Allen never attended the interviews. The 32-year-old man, whose loved ones said was on the cusp of turning a new page in his life, was shot dead by San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies later that day.

Family and friends spoke about Allen, who is black and Samoan, during a vigil on Wednesday at a park in Adelanto. Upwards of 100 supporters, including NBA superstar Dennis Rodman, attended the ceremony to give personal testimony about police shootings, and talk about Allen’s life.

She was a joy because after years of trying they were finally blessed with a baby girl.

Patricia attended Houston Independent School District attending Paul Lawrence Dunbar Elementary, James D. Ryan Middle School and the almighty Jack Yates Senior High School.  She was quiet but well known in the Third Ward Community with having 4 older brothers. You could catch her at Emancipation Park recreation room with her little brother Richard most summers and after school.  Her family lived directly across the street from Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church where she became a member and accepted Christ under the leadership of Rev. David Leon Everett, II.

At the tender age of fifteen, Patricia welcomed her only child a daughter, Patrina Marshall.  For 31 years Pat and Methodist Hospital have had a harmonious relationship. Pat started in the mailroom and worked diligently and faithfully to cultivate her career. Rising through the ranks to become the Executive Administrative Assistant to the Methodist Supply Chain Manager. As the true socialite Pat was well-traveled and involved in everything! Her love for health and wellness was exemplified by her youthful appearance, which Pat attributed to her dedicated exercise routine. Her commitment to physical fitness and the well being of others is embodied by the litany of walks and runs she participated in every year. Thought she participated in dozens of runs annually she had a special connection to American Heart Association Heart Walk 5k, The Sisters Network Walk, Susan B. Komen Walk and The Houston Texas Running with the Bulls 5k. Her philanthropic side wasn't something she chose to advertise. However, she loved to party with a purpose and for over a decade helped raise money for Historically Black Colleges & Universities with the Tom Joyner Foundation's Annual Cruise.

To know Pat is to know how much she enjoyed a good theme! Like everything else in her life once she had her current trend theme she committed to it. If it was an Astros game you could guarantee that Pat had the Astros attire, belt, socks,  shoes, and her signature red lif! Being naturally generous she made sure whatever family member that accompanied her had their own matching attire! More than anything, Patricia loved her family and supported her friends. Her dedication was obvious and appeared effortless. Her father enjoyed photography as a hobby and his doting daughter followed in his footsteps. No matter the event, if Pat was there, so was her camera and her kilowatt smile. If she wasn't taking pictures then she was laying out a feast. Pat was notorious for cooking. She could grill, smother, bake and fry like no other! And was always willing to share any of her gifts and passions with others. She supported her beloved high school Jack Yates and all of her classmates.

Pat was preceded in death by her mother, Bennie Mae Marshall; grandparents Gracie Mae & Bennie Porter (maternal) and Hardy & Mary Marshall (paternal).

Pat's legacy will be honored and continued by her family her Favorite girl and only child Patrina Marshall; father Hardie Marshall, Jr. brothers Harvey, Charles, Roderick, Rodney and Richard; godchild and princess Jayla Foxx and a host of nieces, nephews family, and friends.

Patricia's robust life will be cherished by all those who called her friend, family or the lady always smiling with the camera."

He often spent his lunch breaks at local animal shelters, putting on concerts for cats and dogs because he believed music would help soothe their anxiety. Those who knew him describe him as gentle: “I don’t even think he would set a mouse trap if there was a rodent problem,” said his friend, Eric Behren. He often developed friendships with his massage clients, like April Young, who said: “He had a child-like spirit … He lived in his own little world. He was never into, like, fitting in. He just was who he was.” “He was the sweetest, purest person I have ever met,” another of his friends and former clients, Marna Arnett, added. “He was definitely a light in a whole lot of darkness.” Arnett believes that, in addition to helping manage a chronic chill that McClain attributed to his anemia, wearing a mask helped him manage his social anxiety. “He would hide behind that mask,” Arnett said. “It was protection for him, too. It made him more comfortable being in the outside world.” His mother, Sheneen McClain, described her son as incredibly determined. “I thank God that he was my son because just him being born brought life into my world, you know what I mean?” she said. “I know he was giving life to other people too.”"

She had big dreams, and worked hard to attend college at Xavier University of Louisiana, where she graduated in 2014 with a degree in biology. She hoped to one day become a doctor.

“She was part of the first generation of people in my family to go to college,” said Ashley Carr, 35, who lives in Houston and works as a budget analyst for the Houston Independent School District. “There were plenty of days of struggling, plenty of days of eating ramen noodles for dinner. But that wasn’t a deterrent for her.”

Recently, Ms. Jefferson had been selling medical equipment while studying and saving up to apply for medical school, Ms. Carr said. But after their mother got sick, Ms. Jefferson agreed to move away from Dallas, where she had been living with a roommate, to Fort Worth, where she moved in with their mother, their sister Amber Carr and Amber’s sons, who are 4 and 8.

Ms. Jefferson taught the 8-year-old how to dress himself in the mornings and get ready on time for school, and took the 4-year-old to an indoor playground for his birthday, where she showed him how to go down a slide, her family recalled. Their bond was so close, “sometimes people think that they are her kids and not mine,” Amber Carr said at a news conference this month.

Ashley Carr, who does not have children, recalled how she and Ms. Jefferson had bonded over their “fur babies,” which included Ms. Jefferson’s current brood of three cats and two dogs. The sisters also dabbled in following the stock market together. “We were like, ‘Did you see such and such went down today about 10 points?’” she said. The sisters had no money in the market, she said, “but it was just the point of, that was our camaraderie.” Atatiana Jefferson’s family and friends honored her for what she had been to them in life: a hands-on aunt who took her nephews to arcades and playgrounds; a pet lover who could not say no to animals in need, even once adopting a wild rabbit; and a pillar of family life who, at 28 years old, put her own life on pause to move in with her sick mother.

“Whoever she really cared for, she went all in for it — people and animals,” her sister Ashley Carr said. "

They had a full court.

He was still living at home when he died.

“This is our baby child,” Antoine Bufford said of his son. “Can’t get rid of that last one.”

Cortez always loved fast cars. “I don’t think he knew how to drive slow,” said Monisha Merrill, his sister. His last car was a 1994 Firebird, which Antoine is trying to fix.

A “dork” with glasses who got teased in grade school, Cortez took his first job — apart from his neighborhood lemonade and hot dog stand operation — as a dishwasher at the Old Spaghetti Factory. He loved working there, his parents remember, and was upset with them when he had to quit to take a big family vacation to New Orleans. Photo ops with alligators during a swamp tour cheered him up, but it was a sore spot for years.

He would eat ice cream and watch movies with his nieces and nephews and house-sit for his sister, Ericka Freeman, who described him as her sidekick who “always went for what was right.”

Cortez later took warehouse jobs at FedEx and UPS, earning employee accolades for his forklift operation skills. But he lost his job of several years after failing a drug test for smoking weed, his father said.

One of his last jobs was working at Henry’s Funeral and Cremation Service, a business his cousin Brandon opened in late 2017. It was there that his parents would view his body for the first time and his homegoing service would be held."

He was their baby. Etonne was affectionately known to some as ""easy"" due to his relaxed personality.
 
 During the first few years of his childhood, he was surrounded by his female big cousins, Keishia, Trina, Taimyra and Berneatta (Candy). He hated being the only boy since he typically got into trouble because of something they set him up to participate in. When he finally became the leader of the 80's babies/cousins (that is, Stephen, Natisha, Marrchelle, Antwan, Rasheeda, Dustin, Lil Lo, Crystal, and Ciara) he definitely enjoyed the role of having male cousins to play with but most of all being a big cousin. What he loved even more was when he became a big brother to Daniel.
 
 Etonne was a person who rarely ever complained. To know Etonne was to love Etonne. He was a fun loving person who always smiled . Anyone who ever met him walked away remembering that smile that could light up any room. If there was one phrase to describe him it would be ""he was well loved"".
 
 Etonne received his education from the Baltimore City Public School System. He would often impress you with how much he knew about nature. Etonne stressed to his third and fourth generation cousins about the importance of going to school and receiving an education. Also, Etonne was gainfully employed by Holly Poultry for 10 years where he was a devoted worker.
 
 When he was a young boy, he gave his life to Christ. He was baptized at Gethsemane Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. His favorite hymn was ""I'm on the Battlefield for My Lord"".

Godby High School and two of his greatest social and professional fulfillments were that he successfully earned a knockout as a registered lightweight boxer and his gift of barbering. Tony was able to create designer haircuts, trims and hairstyles for family and friends. If you had the pleasure of hearing him speak with that sexy and sultry voice, then you would know that he had a beautiful singing voice. Tony also played and enjoyed basketball. He was a force to be reckoned with when it came to his chosen sports, he was an all-around athlete. He was phenomenal.

Tony’s most expressed and unconditional love was affectionately shown first to his mother, Wanda, his brother, nieces, nephews and close friends. He wanted nothing more than for the people that he carried in his heart to have a wonderful life. Tony leaves to mourn a loving family to share and treasure his love, his parents: Anthony and Wanda McDade; one brother: Shawn McDade; grandfather: Johnny James; uncle: Elder Greg James; godparents: Charles and Pamela White; godsisters: Ebony Lowe and Carla Dixon; godchildren: Altayzia Hall, Jaiah Hall and Lex Roberson; loving cousin: Elder Michael F.

His demeanor, his father said, was"" jovial."" His family affectionately called him ""Boo."" ""He was always the center of the party, and the center of our family,"" Motley Sr. said. In Motley Jr.'s lifetime, his father said, the two never had a conflict, something he considers rare and special. Carl Adams, Motley Jr.'s cousin, said they were around the same age and grew up close. ""We had a lot of special moments together, you know, for proms, and graduations and girlfriends. A lot of stuff, we did together, because we are one year apart,"" Adams said. Motley Jr.s' early August trip to Memphis was a routine occurrence, something he did about every other month for the last several years. His sister, Tasheta Motley, lived in Memphis until two years ago. A niece and nephew, as well as a close friend, still live in the city. ""Memphis was good to him,"" Motley Sr. said. ""It was a getaway for him. He did nothing but enjoy it every time."" Adams added that Motley Jr. was interested in being in business for himself, and to that end, he worked to get a clothing line up and going, with an eye towards possibly expanding his sales to include Memphis. Because of Motley's deteriorating eyesight, due to Marfan's syndrome, he didn't drive. So he usually came into town with someone. That a person who was central to so many family members was killed over an argument, Adams said, is unexpected, and more importantly, unjustified."""

He was my light.” Although the two were briefly in a romantic relationship, Garrett said she and Sterusky remained very close. “That was my best friend,” she said. “I would talk to him every day.

003159,Amir,,Locke,,22,Male,2022-02-02,1117 S Marquette Ave,Minneapolis,MN,,44.971554,-93.274291,"Amir Locke was born Nov. 11, 1999, at St. John's Hospital in Maplewood, with fat cheeks and a mat of dark hair. The young family started out in St. Paul, but his parents moved to the east metro suburbs of Maplewood and North St. Paul seeking peace and quiet for their sons. Throughout their childhoods, brothers Andre Jr. and Amir were inseparable. In family photos, the boys sit cross-legged in matching sweaters, pose back-to-back in oversized hoodies, and practice synchronizing their footwork in African drum and dance class. Amir Locke, and his older brother, Andre Jr., were two years apart and inseparable growing up. Both were passionate about music, often promoting each other’s songs. As young boys, they would roam the halls of Sonic Edge Studios in Minneapolis with cousin Eryk Loffman, 24, keeping themselves entertained while their fathers recorded rap and hip-hop. They played video games, shot hoops at the park and tumbled around with Loffman's dog at his house in north Minneapolis. Loffman described his cousins fondly as mischief multiplied, always cracking jokes and pushing buttons. The three relied on each other through family instability in their early years. The boys came of age during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. Amir was 13 when Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida. Wells took the boys to a rally for Martin, where she tried to impress upon them how history was in the making. ""Amir was very moved by each of the things that took place during the George Floyd uprising, and also Breonna Taylor, and also going back to Trayvon Martin,"" she said. ""When he looked at those people, he not only saw himself. He saw me, he saw his brother, he saw his uncles, saw his grandfather. And yes, we have trained them to respect the law, and to make the right decisions to make it home safely, but as he became older, he spoke out. He didn't hold his tongue, and he spoke out about things that were unjust to him."" Andre Jr. was more the gregarious performer, according to their parents. Amir was softer and circumspect, with a fear of being misunderstood. He gave football a try at Como Park Senior High, but he soon fractured his collarbone. Both brothers gravitated to their father's love of music and transferred to St. Paul's High School for Recording Arts. The first time Andre Sr. overheard his sons' music, he was walking past the room where they were mixing and started bopping to the beat. It astonished him to learn they made it. They wrote, sang and produced, making trap and hip-hop, pop and soul. They promoted each other on social media and taught their father how to use home recording equipment. ""He gave you what he wanted in return,"" Andre Sr. said. ""He gave you respect, and he ended up earning that respect back from us.""

Almost as common as selfies on Donnell Rochester’s social media were pictures or videos of his mother or posts directed to her. On February 18, 2020, almost exactly two years before he was killed, Rochester posted a picture of Brown with the words “My beautiful mom thanks for being the best mother any child could ever want love you mom.” On his mother’s birthday in 2021, he posted two videos of them dancing. In one, he dances and she follows his moves, shaking her head skeptically after he shakes his butt in front of the camera, but then she follows his lead until both break out in laughter. In the other, the mother and son look ecstatic as they dance. Whenever they used to sing “Can You Stand The Rain” by New Edition, they always argued about who would sing which part. And they often arrived at the same solution, switching parts the next time around. “This little boy really changed my life, like made me be the person I was today,” Brown says of Donnell, who was born September 7, 2003. “If you knew Danielle from growing up, Danielle [was] always out here fighting, in the streets out here really getting it,” Brown’s sister Markia Jackson said. “Donnell really changed her life for the better.

He made his teammates laugh, and at the same time he was a hard worker on the field,” Strickland said. “He was a phenomenal young man.” He was working full-time and had considered moving to Florida to attend a community college, according to Strickland. In school, he was known as a ""kind-hearted soul,"" said Amanda Frampton, a physical education teacher at Milford High School who had Rodney Robinson as one of her students. She said he loved to sing, dance and make others laugh. “Rodney was also the person that would walk up and sit next to a total stranger and start a conversation,” Frampton said. “I know he has made my eyes roll many times but has always put a smile on my face. He will be missed tremendously. All our hearts are broken with this loss.”  Please contact
