              SAY THEIR NAMES is an ongoing research and mapping project, intended to identify and remember Black Americans

              years of research, the concurrent development of an interactive map, and the accumulation of community contributions.
              This map is truly a participatory and interactive project. In the coming months and years as we continue to accumulate
              research data and develop the online interactive map, we will add the capability to submit data through an online form.

              For now, please email us if you have additional information on a currently listed Black American, or with additional

              weapons or those not being actively pursued due to unlawful actions or other complexities.
